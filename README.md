# ⚡Design and Verification of FPGA-Based Wireless Control and Monitoring System Using WiFi

## 🌐 Project Overview

This project designs and verifies an **FPGA-based wireless control and monitoring system** using **WiFi connectivity via UART protocol**. Implemented in **Verilog HDL**, the system enables **remote control of 8 LEDs** and **monitoring of two simulated sensor values** on the FPGA board.

Commands are received wirelessly through an **ESP8266 WiFi module** acting as a UART bridge, allowing **real-time device management**. 🛰️💡

### ✨ The design features:

* 🧠 **UART command parser** that interprets instructions like turning LEDs **ON/OFF** and requesting **sensor status**.
* 🔄 **State machine** for UART transmission managing start, data, and end bytes efficiently.
* 🧪 **Comprehensive Verilog testbench** simulating UART communication for system validation.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. 🔌 Connect the **FPGA** to a **WiFi-enabled UART bridge** (e.g., ESP8266).
2. ⚙️ Load the **Verilog design (`design.v`)** onto the FPGA board.
3. 🧪 Run the **simulation testbench (`testbench.v`)** to verify system operation.
4. 📲 Send UART commands wirelessly such as:

   * `ON1`, `OF1`, `ON2`, `OF2` → Control individual LEDs
   * `STATUS` → Retrieve sensor data
5. 💡 Observe **LED responses** on the FPGA and **sensor data** received via UART terminal.
